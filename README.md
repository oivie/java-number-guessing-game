# java-number-guessing-game

In this game, the computer generates an array of random numbers and sorts it using the bubble sort algorithm. 
The player is then asked to guess the position of a specific number in the sorted array. 
Once the player guesses the position, they are asked to guess the number at that position. 
The game continues until the player correctly guesses both the position and the number.
